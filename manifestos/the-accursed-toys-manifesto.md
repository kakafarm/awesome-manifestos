We Recognize that over 60% of all computer and cartridge game players are well over the age of 25. It is to this larger, and more sophisticated audience that we dedicate our Art.

'Adult Games For Adult Minds' is our second motto, after 'Determined To Disturb'. We know that Art is powerless unless it both thrills AND upsets, and we DO see our work as ART. We will ever endeavor to do both in an intellectually exciting and unsettling manner.

We shall make it our duty to create complete and powerful Works, that have both Playability and Artistic Integrity. We hope to please and shock, pleasure and surprise you!
